# ultra_api_challenge
API automation framework with Cypress and Typescript

The second task will verify your experience with testing the API.
The expected outcome is a Postman collection covering the testing of one of the 4 REST API resources available on https://gorest.co.in/.The authentication token for the requests can be generated on https://gorest.co.in/consumer/login or on https://dummy.restapiexample.com/ (as an alternative in case the first one doesnâ€™t work for you)
You are expected to:
1. Cover as many testing levels and types as possible to make sure your tests are catching all potential critical defects
2. Enable the testing of the provided functionality as part of a CI/CD pipeline (hint: Postman collections can be executed via newman)
3. Describe the chosen API testing approach
4. Provide execution instructions and enough information explaining the final solution
5. An extra bonus is considered developing an automation framework covering the scenarios from the Postman collection
